Energy:
Every round, each player gets 1 more max Energy (starting at 1 and ending at 10)

They can use their energy to play Cards or active certain Game Rules

Attacking / Defending:
When a player attacks with a card on their turn, if there is a card directly across from the attacking card, that card is attacked, otherwise the enemy player is attacked.

If a card attacks another card, they both do damage to each other's health pool equal to their attack damage
Ex.
	(Attack Damage # / Health Pool #)
	A(1 / 5) attacks B(2 / 3)
	A takes 2 damage and is now (1/3 {MAX 5})
	B takes 1 damage and is now (2/2 {MAX 3})

Cards health pool is reset a the beginning of their turn

Dying / Discarding:
When a Card dies (their health pool reaches 0), they are sent to their respective Graveyard
