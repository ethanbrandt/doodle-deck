### Project Purpose
Doodle Deck is being created for a distributed systems project for my university degree. I try to relate every project to my future work and I believe that a networked game has a lot to teach me. I also really wanted an excuse to make a card game (I've never designed one before and it seemed like a lot of fun). (we'll see how much I come regret this given the short timeline)

### Basic Concept

Doodle Deck is an online 1v1 card game that is designed around the positions of cards on the play field.
